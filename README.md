### Hello 👋 this is Pablo
  
#### 🙋‍♂️ Who I am

- 💻 Full stack and data engineer (3 years now)
- 👷 Also past experience as engineer in other fields (industrial machines ⚙️ and buildings 🏛️)  
- 📚 Self taught in Computer Science with [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)     
- 🧰 Graduated at [Fab Academy](http://archive.fabacademy.org/fabacademy2017/opendot/students/103/index.html) in design, fabrication and coding of electronic prototypes (maker enthusiast)     
- 👨‍🎓 Holding Master degree in Building Engineering and Architecture from University of Pavia

💚 Love to relax by being in contact with nature, doing exercise, reading and spending time with people I care

#### 🏗️ Currently doing
- 🌱 I have just completed [a new project](https://github.com/pcolt/iots-full-stack) with an Arduino + Raspberry Pi producing and storing data from a sensor into a InfluxDB database, then a single-page app consumes and displays the data.
- 🌲 I have recently completed a Express-React [single page app](https://github.com/pcolt/react-scraper) and a [micro-service](https://github.com/pcolt/playwright-scraper) which are displaying repositories scraped from Git-Hub by topic. This is my final project for the Helsinki University course [Open Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). The idea is to develop further the project into a customizable platform where external users can run scrapers and download the results.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, free-lance projects or full-time jobs.
