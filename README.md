### Hello there 👋 this is Pablo
  
#### 💻 Full stack software engineer (3 years now)

- 👷 Past experiences as engineer in other fields (industrial machines ⚙️ and buildings 🏛️)  
- 📚 Self taught in computer science with [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)     
- 🧰 Graduated at [Fab Academy](http://archive.fabacademy.org/fabacademy2017/opendot/students/103/index.html) in design, fabrication and coding of electronic prototypes (maker enthusiast)     
- 👨‍🎓 Holding Master degree in Building Engineering and Architecture from University of Pavia

#### 🏗️ Currently doing
- 🌱 I’m currently developing a coupled [Express-React single page app](https://github.com/pcolt/react-scraper) and a [micro-service](https://github.com/pcolt/playwright-scraper) which are displaying repositories scraped from Git-Hub by topic. I am doing this as a kind of final project for the Helsinki University course [Open Full Stack](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) where I am learning all the best practices in modern full-stack development for the Javascript eco-system.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, free-lance projects and standard jobs.
- 🤔 Do you want to help me or just study or have a chat with me? That's cool! I am right now into Typescript, but I also want deep my knowledge on Redis, MongoDb, NextJs... Well, there are plenty of awesome technologies and areas to study and try out there, and do it together is funnier, right?
